## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow the process below to ensure that it is handled appropriately and securely.

### 1. **Private Disclosure Process**
We strongly encourage reporting security vulnerabilities privately to allow us to fix the issue before public disclosure.

You can report vulnerabilities through GitHub's [Security Advisory](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability) feature:

- Go to the repository's [Security tab](https://github.com/atronsgroup/.github/security/advisories).
- Click on "New draft security advisory"
- Provide all necessary details, including:
  - Description of the vulnerability.
  - Steps to reproduce it.
  - The potential impact of the vulnerability.
  - Proof-of-concept code, if available.

### 2. **Email Contact**
If you prefer, you may also report the vulnerability by sending an email to our security team at [devops-adm@atronsgroup.com.br](mailto:devops-adm@atronsgroup.com.br).

In your report, please include:
- Detailed description of the issue.
- Steps for reproducing the vulnerability.
- Proof-of-concept or other supporting documentation.

### 3. **Expected Response Time**
We will respond to vulnerability reports within 72 hours. Once the vulnerability is verified, we will work to patch it as quickly as possible. After the vulnerability is resolved, we will create a GitHub Security Advisory to notify users of the fix.

For any further questions or clarifications, please reach out to the team via the provided security contact.
